### ðŸ¤– AI Agent

> ðŸ’¡ This is not just a chatbot â€” it's an **AI agent**:  

- `LLM` ==> is the brain
- `Tools` ==> is hand (can perform ***actions*** like browsing)
- `LLM` + `Tools` ==> `AI Agent`
- [Lang-Graph][langGraph] is especially use for building `AI Agent`
  - The nervous system that coordinates thoughts & ***actions***
